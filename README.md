<h3 align="center">A Google Chrome extension that makes it easy to mute, unmute and use push-to-talk in Gather Town tabs.</h3>

## Disclaimer

Although working, this is still a work in progress and has not been tested with real use cases yet.
Try it at your own risk.

## Installation

Maybe in the future I'll publish this in Google Chrome webstore.
