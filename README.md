<h1 align="center">Gather Mute</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Google Chrome extension that makes it easy to mute, unmute and use push-to-talk in Gather Town tabs.</h3>

## Installation

Maybe in the future I'll publish this in Google Chrome webstore.

For now, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository, 
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ , choose "Load Unpacked" and load the "ext" folder
3. Configure your shortcuts in chrome://extensions/shortcuts

## Usage

The Extension has 4 commands: Mute, Unmute, Toggle Mute and Push to talk

After installing, don't forget to configure your shortcuts in:

chrome://extensions/shortcuts

I recommend using global shortcuts, so you can control gather without needing to focus on Chrome Window.

## Disclaimer

Although working, this is still a work in progress and has not been tested with real use cases yet.
Try it at your own risk.
